# API Puzzles

The intent of the API puzzles is to see your skill in handling http requests to external data sources to collect data, then maniplulate and visualize that data in a meaningul (value added) way.

### Visualization
It is not enough to simply call the data API and display the data in a table, you need to show some though in how to visualize (organize, display) the data to give more value to the user.


### Usage of API

It is not enough to call a single API, this is too easy.  All code submissions must call *at least* 2 different APIs to collect data from.

- The more different APIs you call to solve your puzzle the more points you will earn.
- The better your visualize your data the more points you will earn


### Tests

It is not enough to simply achieve 100% code coverage for your code. This is fairly simple to achieve with fake tests that execute the code but do not test either the state or behavior.

- The more unit tests you write against you application code the more points you will earn
- The more cucumber+protractor tests (e2e) you write the more points you will earn.
