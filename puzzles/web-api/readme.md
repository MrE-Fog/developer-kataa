# Algorithm Puzzles

The intent of the Algorithm puzzles is not only to see your skill in solving the puzzle,
but to see how you organize and test your code.

### Plagiarism

Unfortunately there are reams of books, blogs and other resources that list various coding exercises, puzzles and tests.  
There are many submissions on StackOverflow asking how to solve a particular problem.  These questions are asked by lazy people
who cannot do the work themselves to solve the problem and want someone else to solve it for them.  This is especially bad
if the puzzle to be solved is for an exam, or an interview.

We are aware of the resources available and warn you that if we find your code posted on the internet it is an automatic fail.

We want you to do your own work.

### Tests

It is not enough to simply achieve 100% code coverage for your code. This is fairly simple to achieve
with fake tests that execute the code but do not test either the state or behavior.

- The more unit tests you write against you application code the more points you will earn
- The more cucumber+protractor tests (e2e) you write the more points you will earn.
