### Input:
    Width: integer - number of horizontal cells in game board
    Height: integer - number of vertical cells in game board
    Seed: string - space or comma delimited string of booleans. List is equivalent to a double dimension array corresponding to the game board dimensions.

Support multiple game modes:
- Allow for either interactive evolution (push a button for each tic),
- Timed evolution (time delay between tics)
- End state evolution (complete specified number of tics and show final population map)

#### Bonus 1:

Interactive seed creator: create UI that allows user to click on/off each cell before running simulation.

#### Bonus 2:
