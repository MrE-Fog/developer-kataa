# TMNG Project requirements

Make sure you have read and understood the main [README](https://ssh///bitbucket.corporate.t-mobile.com/tmo/developer-puzzles/blob/master/README.md) before you visit this doc.



## TMNG

For TMNG the foundational stack is

 - AngularJS (1.6.x)
 - AEM (6.3.x)
 - ES5
 - Java (8)
 - Sightly.

We are upgrading to

- Angular (6)
- AEM 6.4
- Typesecript (2.5+)
- Java (8)
- Sightly.


For the short term we need developers to be comfortable in both sides of the upgrade

- aem 6.1 vs 6.4
- AngularJS 1.6 vs Angular 6
- ES-5 vs Typescript 2.5+

For new contractors coming onto the project we need deep knowledge of the former stack (AngularJS, AEM 6.3), hence all code submissions must be in this stack
