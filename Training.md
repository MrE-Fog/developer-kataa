# Project on-boarding and training:

Project on-boarding is more intense because we want to make sure that you fully understand our development environment
and the foundation basis of our code.  For this purpose we want you to review our published
[coding standards guidelines](https://tmobile.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MAG/pages/194675089/c.+Coding+Guidelines+and+Best+Practices)

You will likely need a full sprint to complete all aspects fo the on-boarding project.

Pay particular attention to :

- the quality of your code
    - we read code much more than we write code, so write your code in a very understandable **format** and **structure** with **good naming conventions** to make reading as painless as possible.
        - the *read-ability* of your code
        - the structure of your solution
        - the linted quality of your source files
- the structure of your unit tests
- the completeness of your unit test
    - particularly the logical reason and value for each test.


Once you have completed your solution you should enter a code review and refactor loop until you clean-up your code to meet current codings standards and guidelines.


## AEM / Java

TBD.


## Angular\[JS|\d+\]

For on-boarding exercises you must create the build environment yourself, do not copy the seed environment settings.
The goal here is learning thru research and exercise of your problem solving muscles.  Once you have a reasonable
build environment working you can reference the seed to see how well you did.  **Do not cheat**;
make sure you try to complete this part of the exercise to the best of your ability before you reference the seed.

To start you should solve a puzzle with AngularJS 1.6 and ES5.  This is the basis of the TMNG project.

Once you have achieved a high level of reviewed code quality you should then re-solve the same puzzle using the latest Angular+ (4,5,6...) with Typescript.  
For the Angular+ solution you will use the angular-cli to scaffold and build your solution, do not use the **seed** starter from the AngularJS solution.

When you are done you will have a solid understanding of not only the basics of both AngularJS and Angular+,
and how to produce quality code that meets our coding standards and quality guidelines,
but you will be able to compare and contrast the relative strengths and weaknesses of the two frameworks.
