# Contributing to the Developer Puzzles Repo

The intent was to weed out NTW candidates that were under-qualified for our project.  It later grew to be used as a training tool
for new FTE devs to help them be intimately familiar with the core tech stack and tools our project is working with.

This repo was started with a small subset of puzzles to be solved.  It by no means covers to gambit of tech stacks or problem sets that we want developers to be aware of.

We welcome any new additions to the set of problems.

Some of the ideas we wanted to come up with are those that require accessing a public api
i.e.
- reddit
- yahoo weather
- github
- bitbucket

Anything that exposes a public API that can be built.

Developer puzzles must have a well defined scope that can be completed in a reasonably short amount of time.

Please add your new developer puzzle definitions to the /puzzles folder, then add a link in the main [README](READM.me) file, or in your project specific file if the puzzle is stack specific.
