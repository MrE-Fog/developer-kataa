# Developer Puzzles

Candidate puzzles are small coding challenges given to developers.

We want to see how well developers write their code, with tests.  
Each challenge is fairly simple to solve, although they get progressively more difficult near the bottom of the list.

Developers should concentrate on solving these puzzles with high quality code,
and exemplification of software craftsmanship.  This includes a thorough test automation suite
using karma/mocha/chai/sinon for unit tests and protractor/webdriver/cucumber for UI/Functional tests.

Emphasis is on code quality, structure, design and most importantly - tests.
