# Developer Puzzles

Candidate puzzles are small coding challenges given to developers.

We want to see how well developers write their code, and especially how they test their code.  
Each challenge is fairly simple to solve, although they get progressively more difficult near the bottom of the list.

## Caution

Each challenge can be found online with multiple reference solutions.
To take advantage of this challenge **do not** use google to solve the problem.
We have seen most of the solutions available on the web.  If you plagiarize your solution,
we will likely know.  You may still try to impress us with your tests, but we will know
that you copied the solution - This is a personal integrity issue.  **don't do it**

## Focus

Developers should concentrate on solving these puzzles with high quality code,
and exemplification of software craftsmanship.  This includes a thorough test automation suite
using karma/mocha/chai/sinon for unit tests and protractor/webdriver/cucumber for UI/Functional tests.

Emphasis is on code quality, structure, design and most importantly - tests.


## Tools

Use the following tools for your solution and dev environment

- npm
- mocha
- chai
- sinon
- eslint
- karma
- protractor


For an added challenge, and learning of preferred tools, try adding the following:

- cucumber
- LESS (instead of SASS, Stylus or plain CSS)
- material design (angular-material)

**Do not use Bower**
**Do not use Twitter Bootstrap**
