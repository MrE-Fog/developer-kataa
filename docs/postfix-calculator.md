## Polish Notation Calculator (post fix)

   Given:  Input of numbers and operators in postfix order onto a stack.  When operators are entered they operate on the top 1 or more numerical entries as appropriate.

   Sample:  Input:   3.5 2 + 4.25 4 x  -      Output:   11.5     : why:   (4.25x4)-(3.5+2.0)

   Bonus: allow for stack operations like clear, drop, swap, roll
